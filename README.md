# Clusterization with DBSCAN and K-Means 

Goal: compare two clustering algorithms with spatial data.

Dataset: https://dados-geoniteroi.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/545dd49be2c84123bac20024411b663f_10/explore?location=-22.923301%2C-43.059100%2C13.71

## **Streamlit**
The visualization is also compiled into a streamlit script. To do this, just install the dependencies in requirements-streamlit.txt and run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run Clustering.py
